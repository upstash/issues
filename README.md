### Upstash Roadmap


Welcome 👋  

This repo is hosting discussions for what we’re building, what’s already live, and what might come next - together with your feedback. 💡

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here
- **In Progress** - Things we’re actively working on right now.
- **Deployed** - Features that are finished and already available.
- **Feature Request** - Ideas we’re considering for the future. You can vote and comment here to tell us what’s most important to you!
_(Heads up: not everything in the **feature request** will make it to production - we pick based on overall demand and what benefits most users.)_


## 💬 Want to Suggest Something New?
If you have an idea that’s not listed here, we’d love to hear it!
You can reach us anytime through:

- 💬 [Discord](https://upstash.com/discord)
- 💻 Chat popup on [our website](https://upstash.com/)
- ✉️ [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com)

**For SDK specific issues** → please use the repo of that SDK (e.g., [`@upstash/redis`](https://github.com/upstash/redis-js), [`@upstash/qstash`](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-js)).  

Thanks for helping us shape the future of Upstash! 💙
